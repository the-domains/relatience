Let me tell you one thing about children. They are never short of questions. "What would a tree say to a car?", my five year old son asked me a few years ago. "Don't hit me?", I suggested, but he insisted that a tree would ask "Don't pollute me, please", as he fortunately never saw a car hit a tree. 

This question, in particular, stuck with me as it can be easily extrapolated to communication between any two entities. Absurd idea, you may think, but it is not as much as it used to be. Precisely the idea that apparently innate objects, animals, machines, anything, has the potential to convey information to people, but also to each other, demonstrates a core problem researchers face today. 

As more and more sensor data becomes available and social network data becomes abundant, questions can become wilder, broader and more complex than ever before. The sheer amounts of data forces researchers to be more specific in the questions they ask. Increasingly, data is driving theory, and where many sciences (including the social sciences) were often facing limitations due to lack of data, we may have to prepare for a lack of questions.

This website will trace my involvement in projects related to network analyses and internet of things. Also, it will feature news on developments in these areas that have attracted my attention.
